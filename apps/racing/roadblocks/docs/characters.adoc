This may make a lot more sense as a spreadsheet, at least initially.

== Main/Common

Q: Just start with the rainbow?

=== Red

Red's a fire-cracker.
She works hard, plays harder, and don't take no crap from no one.

Her theme song is "I Can't Drive 55."

Her motto is "It's better to burn out than to fade away."

Offense: fire ball (tornado?)
Speed boost: afterburner (fries racers behind you)
Booby trap: don't want to be too much like Blaze

=== Yellow

Texture: sponge

Yellow's a gleeful, stupid, nearly indestructible sponge.

His theme song is the derivative of Sponge Bob Square Pants'.
The one where he lives in a pineapple/hot pepper/chicken parmesan hero/under the pineapple (serious recursion) that Mal loves.

His motto:

Offense: ??
Speed boost: invulnerability bubble
Booby trap: jellyfish tentacles

=== Green

This one seems like it should be the hippy

=== Blue

Tempting to think of this one as the cop

== Rare

If we start with the rainbow above, brown seems like an obvious choice here.

I think other shapes are interesting possibilities.
Multi-colored tetrahedron.

== Super-Rare

=== Black

The absorber.

Theme song: "Thus Spake Zarathustra" seems likely.
Or maybe the theme from Jaws.

Offense: give some zap to the racer behind your nearest competitor
Speed boost: mirror (show off rendering and bounce attacks back at source)
Booby trap:

==== Notes

When speed boosted, switch texture to mirror surroundings.
Probably shouldn't actually go faster.

Doesn't need to be fast. Ultimately, everyone else comes here.

== Special

=== Robot

Texture map should be something like spinning wheels

=== Storm

Theme song: AC/DC "Thunderstruck"

Texture: swirling clouds w/ lightning

Offense: tornado
Speed boost: what happens to other racers as you blow past?
Booby trap: ice patch that makes you lose control
