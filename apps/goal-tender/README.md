# goal-tender

Nurture your goals to fruition.

## Purpose

This is a learning experiment, for now. I want the basic app, and I want
it to be something that runs in frereth.

So I'm trying to play both ends against the middle.

## Installation

Clone from https://github.com/jimrthy/frereth.

(You really don't want to touch this yet).

TODO: Make this more like

    $ frereth run goal-tender-0.1.0-standalone.jar


## Usage

TODO: Sort this out

It should be something along the lines of

    $ java -jar goal-tender-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

Actually, it should be more along the lines of

    $ frereth run goal-tender-0.1.0-standalone.jar

## Options
