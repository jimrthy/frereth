What is this?
=============

A few years back, I got a hare-brained idea to put together a
SmallTalk-like environment for Common Lisp. It seems so obvious.

This project is bigger than that.

I still intend for that to be a part of this, but it probably
belongs under [https://github.com/jimrthy/fride](fride).

Frereth is more ambitious, and involves lots more pieces.

Hopefully it's simmered long enough that it won't just be
vaporware for much longer.
