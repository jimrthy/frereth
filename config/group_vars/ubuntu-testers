  # TODO: Honestly, there are two groups of libraries here.
  # One set is underlying system pieces that I don't have any interest
  # in ever updating. I really just want a personal copy so I have a
  # baseline that doesn't get broken by everyone else.
  # Those pieces should really be attached to a 'builder' user
  # (who doesn't really have any good reason to have sudo access)
  # then installed by a sudoer.
  # The main dev user doesn't have any reason to ever think about these
  # libraries once they're installed, so they really should be hidden
  # away elsewhere anyway.

  # It shouldn't be. That's a different story for another day.
