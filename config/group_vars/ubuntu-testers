  # TODO: Honestly, there are two groups of libraries here.
  # One set is underlying system pieces that I don't have any interest
  # in ever updating. I really just want a personal copy so I have a
  # baseline that doesn't get broken by everyone else.
  # Those pieces should really be attached to a 'builder' user
  # (who doesn't really have any good reason to have sudo access)
  # then installed by a sudoer.
  # The main dev user doesn't have any reason to ever think about these
  # libraries once they're installed, so they really should be hidden
  # away elsewhere anyway.

  # It's more than a little silly to install this here, but there aren't
  # a lot of alternatives. Since frereth-renderer is heavily dependent on
  # it.
  # It shouldn't be. That's a different story for another day.
  # Much more importantly: there's a submodule (autodoc) that didn't
  # really seem to get cloned correctly when I forked. So I get an error
  # the first time I try to actually clone the repo.
  # That's not a big enough stumbling point to be worth trying to track
  # down and figure out what's going on, but it's pretty annoying.
