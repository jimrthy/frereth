Containers:

* baseline - freshly cloned
* installable - What is this?
* frereth - baseline that has the basic users added and software installed
* frereth-just-repositories - I had issues cloning git repos. So this seemed
  like a worthwhile milestone to flag.
* frereth-salty - has libsodium and libzmq installed and, at least
  theoretically, ready to go
* frereth-built-jzmq : Have jzmq with my curve wrapper installed into the local
  maven repo
* frereth-work - what I'm working on. Should spawn off milestones as I go
