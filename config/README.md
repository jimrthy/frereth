Start with begin.sh. This gives at least an overview of how
to set up an lxc to become a frereth...I should probably
come up with a spiffy name for the thing that actually does
the work. Maybe a runner?

Anyway. It's a very amorphous guideline that should show
you the steps you can take to get something (pretty much
anything really...I'm just using lxc because it's convenient
for the setup I have now. You could use vagrant or AWS or
bare metal or anything else that strikes your fancy) that's
a base-line system that's ready to have the "real" frereth
installed (for some value of "real").

After that, try running the setup script. Currently, it's
totally broken...that's why this is still in a branch instead
of part of master.

Hopefully that will change in the very near future.
