Start with begin.sh. This gives at least an overview of how
to set up an lxc to become a frereth...I should probably
come up with a spiffy name for the thing that actually does
the work. Maybe a runner?

Anyway. It's a very amorphous guideline that should show
you the steps you can take to get something (pretty much
anything really...I'm just using lxc because it's convenient
for the setup I have now. You could use vagrant or AWS or
bare metal or anything else that strikes your fancy) that's
a base-line system that's ready to have the "real" frereth
installed (for some value of "real").

After that, try running the setup script. It probably won't
work for you out of the box.

If you aren't comfortable with things like python virtual
environments and shell scripting, this really isn't in
any sort of shape for you to tackle yet.

You'd probably be better off just cloning the individual
repos involved and getting them to run manually.

The hard part, really, was jzmq the last time I did this.

Feel free to contact me with any issues, but I can't promise
to check for those very often.
