== Plan

=== Installation

Have some sort of setup script that sets up database schemas and then
adds things like privileged user accounts and trusted hosts.

The basic idea is that admins should be able to manage things via the
GUI from either inside the local network or from specific trusted
machines.

It may be worth setting up options for 2-way TLS verification (or
whatever the terminology is to indicate that the server authorizes
client certs) to allow other remote options, but that seems like a
next-gen sort of thing.

=== Auth

I'd like to use Buddy.

I'd also really like to use FIDO.

The two are not mutually exclusive, but this approach may take more
effort that just hacking together something bespoke.

It's totally worth doing, and may be a good way to get other people
involved.

On the other hand...the W3C has a new authentication standard that's
supported in varying degrees in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
